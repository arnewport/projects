A straightforward game of blackjack.

Supports hitting, standing, doubling, and splitting.
Does not support betting, surrendering, or insurance.
Uses a single deck that is reshuffled after every game.

The basic rules of the game can be found here:

This is the third iteration of simpleBlackjack.
The first was a terminal game written in Python.
The second was a browser game written in Javascript, but visually imitated the terminal game.
The third (and likely final) iteration includes card and score animations.
The previous iterations will be uploaded eventually to display my progress over time.
